            <p>
              Food wastage is a growing concern. With nearly 40% of food in the
              U.S. being wasted and families losing approximately $1,500 a year
              on thrown-out groceries, we are constantly seeking ways to save
              both time and money. This is where{" "}

              steps in, revolutionizing the way we interact with our kitchen.
            </p>

            <p>
              Over the course of a semester, our team developed a mobile
              application coupled with a 3D digital twin, transforming the
              kitchen experience. As the project leader, I spearheaded the
              integration of a user-friendly interface with practical product
              design. Key feature include: Auto-Restocking, Automatic Recipe
              Generator, and In-Fridge Camera System.
            </p>

            <p>
              FridgeFriend was met with enthusiastic feedback during our final
              presentation, particularly because it simplifies the
              decision-making process, making sustainable living both intuitive
              and effortless.

              FridgeFriend uses in-fridge cameras to track what you have, when
              it expires, and what you need to buy. The system alerts you when
              food is about to go bad, suggests recipes based on your current
              inventory, and automates reordering. The goal: reduce the 40% of
              household food waste while making grocery shopping less of a chore.
              Built and tested with NYC households over a semester-long project.

                We narrowed down our scope to only focus on food inventory

                media to both create a user interface but also a 3D model of our
                product. By iterating our ideas, we created a solution that is

                iterating on solutions. With each feedback session, we leveraged

            <p>
              Our team is diverse, encompassing expertise in engineering,
              humanity and supply chain management, initially posed a challenge
              in aligning our perspectives. However, this diversity soon
              transformed into our greatest asset. By valuing and integrating
              each member's unique insights and skills, we were able to
              effectively blend industrial design with UI/UX principles. This
              collaborative synergy was instrumental in refining our solution to
              address food waste sustainability.

              The Value of Refining the Problem Statement
            </h4>
            <p>
              Initially, our problem statement was broad and somewhat nebulous.
              Through repeated brainstorming and iteration, we honed in on a
              more precise and manageable scope. This process of reflection and
              revision was invaluable. It taught us the importance of taking the
              time to accurately define the problem, even if it means starting
              over. This approach not only streamlined our design process but
              also ensured that our efforts were targeted and effective.
